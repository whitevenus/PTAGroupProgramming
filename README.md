# PTA

> The Zhejiang University Computer Programming Ability Test (Programming Ability Test, abbreviated as PAT) is a unified examination organized by the School of Computer Science and Technology of Zhejiang University.
> It aims to cultivate and demonstrate students’ ability to analyze problems, solve problems, and design computer programs, scientifically evaluate talents in computer programming, and provide a reference standard for enterprises to select talents.

Although calling PAT the ‘TOEFL of the IT industry’ may be a bit exaggerated, the value of PAT is undeniable and evident to all."
